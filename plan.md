## Current Focus
ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 9: Kaikki.org Local Dictionary Database - Ready for testing**

## How to Use the Dictionary Downloader

### Step 1: Download the dictionary (246 MB)
```bash
python -m app.utils.dictionary_downloader download
```

### Step 2: Import into SQLite database (takes 5-10 minutes)
```bash
python -m app.utils.dictionary_downloader import
```

### Step 3: The app will automatically use the local database
- Word lookups will be instant (no network requests)
- Works offline after initial download
- Contains 100,000+ Finnish words with full conjugations/declensions

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Kaikki.org Dictionary Integration
- **Source**: https://kaikki.org/dictionary/Finnish/kaikki.org-dictionary-Finnish.jsonl
- **Format**: JSONL (JSON Lines) - one entry per line
- **Size**: 246 MB (uncompressed), ~100,000 entries
- **Data Structure**: 
  - Entry contains: word, pos, senses (definitions), forms (inflections), etymology
  - Forms array has 50-200+ entries per word with grammatical tags
  - Tags indicate person, number, case, tense, mood, etc.
  
### Verb Conjugation Extraction
- Filter forms by tags: `['present', 'indicative', 'first-person', 'singular']` â†’ minÃ¤ form
- Skip negative forms (tags containing 'negative')
- Extract all 6 persons: minÃ¤, sinÃ¤, hÃ¤n, me, te, he
- Extract verb type from inflection_templates or class tag (e.g., '52/sanoa')

### Noun Declension Extraction
- Filter forms by case tags: nominative, genitive, partitive, etc.
- Determine singular/plural by checking for 'singular' or 'plural' in tags
- Store both forms for all 15 Finnish noun cases
- Handle special cases like comitative and instructive

### Database Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE words (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    word TEXT NOT NULL,
    pos TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'verb' or 'noun'
    definition TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE verb_conjugations (
    word_id INTEGER,
    person TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'minÃ¤', 'sinÃ¤', 'hÃ¤n', 'me', 'te', 'he'
    form TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY(word_id) REFERENCES words(id)
);

CREATE TABLE noun_declensions (
    word_id INTEGER,
    case_name TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'nominative', 'genitive', etc.
    singular TEXT,
    plural TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY(word_id) REFERENCES words(id)
);
```

### Performance Optimization
- Indexed lookups on word column: O(log n) query time
- Single SQL query retrieves all conjugations/declensions
- No network requests after initial database creation
- ~10 MB database file size after compression
